 britano_roman_desc: "#size:15    #F The $britano_roman_collective_noun$, or simply $briton_collective_noun$, were the varyingly Romanized $old_brythonic$ who inhabited Britannia until the Vth century when the province gradually fell into a military anarchy due to $pictish$, $irish$ and $old_saxon$ raids. When Rome finally gave up Britain around the year 440, opportunistic British warlords established their own Kingdoms utilizing $germanic$ mercenaries who often tended to usurp leadership for themselves. In some cases however, the ruling elite seems to have maintained itself and simply got assimilated by their retinues over the centuries. By the VIIth century, the $briton_collective_noun$ have either been culturally assimilated into new $old_anglian_prefix$-$old_saxon$ groups, or have gradually evolved into the various $brythonic$ peoples.#!"
 briton_desc: "#size:15    #F The $old_brythonic_collective_noun$ were the original inhabitants of the island of Britain prior to the $roman$ conquest. After Claudius' Invasion, the island was gradually integrated into the wider $roman$ world, leading to the steady $roman$ization of the $old_brythonic_collective_noun$ within the province while those beyond the walls to the north would eventually evolve into the ancestors of the $picts$. While the original $old_brythonic_collective_noun$ are long gone, their language, as well as aspects of their culture, survive in the later $britano_roman$ and $pictish$ traditions."
 ancient_egyptian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Egyptians were the ancient inhabitants of the Nile Valley stretching from Aswad all the way to the Nile Delta. Though they have never disappeared, the Egyptians have undergone multiple stages of development since the first dynasties arose in the IVth millennium BC. The conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great has opened the way for the gradual hellenization of the native Egyptians who adopted the Greek alphabet for their own language while also converting to Christianity starting in the Ist century AD while under $roman$ rule, gradually evolving into the early Copts. In most recent history, Egypt fell under the control of the Islamic Caliphates, marking the beginning of the gradual Arabization and Islamization of the local Coptic populace. Characterized by their egyptian heritage and Coptic language, the descendants of the ancient Egyptians continue to inhabit the lands along the Nile despite the gradual linguistic and religious shift that has been occurring since the VIIth century.#!"
 karluk_desc: "#size:15    #F The $karluk_collective_noun$ were a $turk$ic nomadic people who played a significant role in the medieval history of Central Asia. Originally part of the $gokturk$ Khaganate, they later established their own confederation and were instrumental in the formation of the Karakhanid Khanate. The $karluk_collective_noun$ were among the first $turk$ic groups to convert to Islam, blending their nomadic traditions with Persian and Islamic influences. Characterized by their $turk$ic heritage and warrior ethos, the $karluk_collective_noun$ were key players in the shifting power dynamics of Central Asia."
 yeniseian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Yeniseians are an ancient Siberian people who once inhabited large parts of western and central Siberia, likely dominating the region before being gradually displaced by incoming Turkic, Ugric, and Tungusic groups. Today, only the Ket people remain, speaking a highly endangered language along the middle Yenisei River. Their language family, Yeniseian, is unique in Eurasia and unrelated to surrounding tongues. Some scholars propose a distant linguistic link between Yeniseian and certain Native American languages, suggesting a deep prehistoric connection, though this remains debated. Occasionally associated with the ruling class of ancient steppe powers like the Xiongnu, the Yeniseians may have once played a far greater role in Inner Asian history than their modern obscurity suggests.#!"
 xiongnu_desc: "#size:15    #F The Xiongnu or 'Asia Huns' were a powerful nomadic confederation that emerged on the eastern Eurasian steppe during the late IIIrd century BC, becoming the first historically documented steppe empire to challenge the Han Dynasty of China. Also related with the early Oghuric people. Originating north of the Great Wall, in what is now Mongolia and southern Siberia, the Xiongnu united various tribes under a centralized leadership known as the Chanyu, establishing a political structure that would serve as a model for later steppe empires. Highly skilled in mounted warfare and archery, the Xiongnu relied on a mobile pastoralist economy, with horses, sheep, and cattle forming the backbone of their society. Their raids and military campaigns against the Han forced the Chinese to strengthen and expand the Great Wall, as well as develop sophisticated diplomatic and military strategies to contain Xiongnu influence. At times, relations between the two powers oscillated between brutal warfare and uneasy peace, marked by marriage alliances and tribute systems. By the Ist century AD, internal divisions and sustained pressure from the Han Empire led to the fragmentation of the Xiongnu confederation. One branch, the Southern Xiongnu, submitted to Han authority, while the Northern Xiongnu continued to resist but eventually faded from historical prominence. Some scholars suggest that remnants of the Xiongnu migrated westward, possibly contributing to the formation of later nomadic groups such as the Huns. Characterized by their sophisticated confederational structure, nomadic warfare, and enduring influence on steppe geopolitics, the Xiongnu marked the beginning of a long tradition of steppe empires that would shape the history of both Asia and Europe.#!"
 tujue_desc: "#size:15    #F The Tujues were a $turk$ic nomadic confederation known in Chinese sources as the $gokturk$s. They established the first known $turk$ic empire in the VIth century, controlling vast territories across the Eurasian steppe. Their society was highly militarized, and they played a key role in the politics of China, Persia, and Byzantium. Characterized by their $turk$ic heritage and steppe warrior culture, the Tujues laid the groundwork for future $turk$ic empires.#!"
 kurdish_desc: "#size:15    #F The Kurds are a people native to the mountainous regions of the Zagros and Taurus ranges, with historical roots tracing back to the early IInd millennium BC. Though their precise ethnogenesis remains debated, the Kurds are believed to descend from a mix of ancient $iran$ian, Hurrian, and possibly Gutian tribes that inhabited these lands. By the Ist millennium BC, the Medes, often considered among their ancestors, rose to prominence, playing a crucial role in the downfall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Over the centuries, the Kurds maintained a strong warrior tradition, resisting foreign domination while adapting to various empires, including the Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids. During the medieval period, Kurdish principalities emerged, exerting regional influence despite the pressures of larger imperial entities. Characterized by their $iran$ian linguistic heritage and resilient mountain culture, the Kurds have remained a distinct and enduring people throughout history.#!"
 armenian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Armenians are an ancient people who have inhabited the Armenian Highlands since at least the Ist millennium BC. Emerging as a distinct culture under the influence of Hurrian, Urartian, and later Indo-European elements, the Armenians gradually consolidated into a unified identity. By the early IInd millennium BC, they had already begun forming political entities, culminating in the powerful Kingdom of Urartu, which was eventually succeeded by the Kingdom of Armenia. Throughout antiquity and the medieval period, Armenia stood at the crossroads of great empires, including the Achaemenids, Romans, Byzantines, and various Islamic dynasties. Despite repeated conquests, the Armenians managed to preserve their distinct language, traditions, and Christian faith, which they adopted in the early IVth century.#!"
 gaul_desc: "#size:15    #F The Gallic were a branch of the Celtic peoples who inhabited what is now France, Belgium, and parts of Italy and Germany during the Ist millennium BC. Organized into numerous independent tribes, they engaged in both trade and conflict with neighboring civilizations, including the Romans and Germanic peoples. By the IInd century BC, the Gallic had established powerful confederations, but their resistance to Roman expansion ultimately failed with Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul in the Ist century BC. As Roman influence spread, the Gallic gradually adopted Latin language and Roman customs, leading to a fusion of Gallic and Roman traditions. This cultural synthesis laid the foundation for what would later be recognized as a Roman-Gallic identity. By the early medieval period, Gallic identity had largely merged into emerging Romance-speaking groups, such as the Frankish peoples in northern Gaul. Nevertheless, elements of Gallic heritage persisted in regional traditions, place names, and linguistic substrata. Characterized by their transition from Celtic to Romanized identities, the Gallics played a key role in shaping the cultural transformation of Western Europe. Their warrior ethos, vibrant artistic traditions, and complex tribal societies left a lasting imprint on European history.#!"
 anglo_saxon_desc: "#size:15    #F The $old_anglian_prefix$-$old_saxon_collective_noun$ were a collection of Angelic speaking peoples that inhabited Britain since the Sub-$roman$ Period from Vth century onward. Descending from the assimilated $britano_roman_collective_noun$ and various $germanic$ mercenaries groups, they were never a truly unified force. However, due to the efforts of writers like Bede, the Angelic speaking inhabitants of the many $germanic$ kingdoms would gradually develop a common Angelcynn identity that distinguished itself from the $frankish_collective_noun$ on the mainland and Brittonic speaking $britano_roman_collective_noun$ of Wales and Cornwall.#!"
 alamannic_desc: "#size:15    #F The $alamannic_collective_noun$ were a confederation of $germanic$ tribes that emerged in the IIIrd century AD along the upper Rhine. Initially raiders who frequently clashed with the $roman$ frontier, they eventually settled in what is now Swabia, forming a distinct cultural and linguistic identity. Despite their incorporation into the $frankish$ realm in the VIth century, the Alemannic dialects and traditions persisted, influencing the development of later Swabian and Swiss identities.#!"
 old_suebi_desc: "#size:15    #F The Suebis were a collection of $germanic$ tribes that originated from the Elbe region and later migrated into various parts of Europe. Known for their distinctive knot hairstyles and warrior traditions, they played a key role in the $germanic$ migrations of the Ist and IInd centuries AD. A faction of the Suebis famously crossed into Hispania in the early Vth century, where they established a short-lived kingdom before being absorbed by the Visigoths.#!"
 langobard_desc: "#size:15    #F The Langobards also known as Lombard were a $germanic$ people originally from the lower Elbe who migrated southward over the course of centuries. By the VIth century AD, they successfully invaded Italy, overthrowing the Ostrogothic kingdom and establishing the Lombard Kingdom. Though eventually defeated by the $frankish_collective_noun$, their influence remained strong, and they played a significant role in shaping the medieval identity of northern Italy.#!"
 norse_desc: "#size:15    #F The Norses were seafaring $germanic$ peoples who inhabited Scandinavia, known for their raids, trade, and exploration throughout the early medieval period. Their influence stretched from the British Isles to the eastern reaches of Russia, with settlements even in distant lands such as Iceland and Greenland. Though commonly associated with the Viking Age, their culture was deeply rooted in earlier North $germanic$ traditions.#!"
 geat_desc: "#size:15    #F The Geats were a North $germanic$ people who inhabited what is now southern Sweden. Known from legendary sources such as Beowulf, they played a crucial role in early Scandinavian history. Eventually, they were unified with the Swedes, forming the foundation of the medieval Swedish kingdom. Despite this integration, Geatish identity persisted for centuries, influencing the cultural landscape of Sweden.#!"
 dane_desc: "#size:15    #F The Danes were a powerful North $germanic$ people originating from the region of modern Denmark. By the early medieval period, they were one of the dominant Viking groups, conducting raids and establishing settlements across the North Sea world. Over time, the Danes transitioned from raiders to kingdom builders, forming one of the earliest centralized Scandinavian states.#!"
 svear_desc: "#size:15    #F The Svears, or Swedes, were a North $germanic$ people who dominated central Sweden during the early medieval period. They played a crucial role in the expansion of Norse influence into the east, with many Svears participating in trade and warfare along the Baltic and Russian river networks. Over time, they united with the Geats, forming the medieval Swedish kingdom.#!"
 old_saxon_desc: "#size:15    #F The $old_saxon_collective_noun$ were a warlike $germanic$ people who inhabited the North Sea coastlines of present-day Germany and the Netherlands. Their seafaring nature led them to raid and later settle in Britain during the early medieval period, forming the foundation of $old_anglian_prefix$-$old_saxon$ England. Those who remained on the continent eventually fell under the rule of the Carolingians but retained a distinct identity well into the medieval era.#!"
 old_anglian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Angles were a $germanic$ people who originated from northern Germany and later migrated to Britain during the early medieval period. Alongside the $old_saxon_collective_noun$ and Jutes, they played a key role in the formation of $old_anglian_prefix$-$old_saxon$ England. Their name lives on in England, which derives from Angle-land, reflecting their lasting impact on British history.#!"
 jute_desc: "#size:15    #F The Jutes were a lesser-known $germanic$ group who, like the Angles and $old_saxon_collective_noun$, migrated to Britain in the early medieval period. Though their independent identity faded over time, they contributed to the formation of early English culture and society, particularly in regions such as Kent.#!"
 frankish_desc: "#size:15    #F The $frankish_collective_noun$ were a powerful $germanic$ people who rose to prominence in the late $roman$ period. Initially a tribal confederation, they eventually established the $frankish$ Kingdom, which evolved into the Carolingian Empire. Their conquests laid the foundation for medieval France and Germany, and their legacy endured through both the Holy $roman$ Empire and the later French state.#!"
 gothic_desc: "#size:15    #F The Goths, colloquially also known as the Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Tetraxites (Crimean Goths), are an East $germanic$ people that hailed from the northern shores of the Black Sea. While their origin can probably be traced back to the Vistula and possibly even Scandinavia, concrete evidence of a distinct Gothic people only emerges after the Tervingi and Greuthungi crossed the Danube into $roman$ territory during the IVth century. Following a series of conflicts between the Romans and Huns, and amidst various $roman$ Civil Wars, the Goths established their own kingdoms in Gaul, later Iberia, and Italy. While the Goths assimilated into wider $roman$ culture for the most part, they nevertheless left their mark on the mediterranean landscape for centuries, especially so in Iberia and Southern France where Visigothic Laws persisted way into the Xth century and beyond.#!"
 visigothic_desc: "#size:15    #F The Visigoths were a branch of the Gothic people who famously sacked Rome in 410 AD before settling in Gaul and later Iberia. They established the Visigothic Kingdom, which dominated the Iberian Peninsula until the Muslim conquest in the VIIIth century.#!"
 ostrogothic_desc: "#size:15    #F The Ostrogoths were a branch of the Gothic people who settled in the Balkans and later established a kingdom in Italy after the fall of the Western $roman$ Empire. Their rule was short-lived, as they were ultimately conquered by the Byzantines in the VIth century.#!"
 vandalic_desc: "#size:15    #F The Vandals were an East $germanic$ people who migrated through Gaul and Iberia before establishing a powerful kingdom in North Africa. They famously sacked Rome in 455 AD, and their rule lasted until the Byzantines reconquered their territory in the VIth century.#!"
 burgundian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Burgundians were an East $germanic$ people who settled in Gaul, forming the Kingdom of Burg.#!"
 russian_desc: "#size:15    #F The formation of the Rus' began with the arrival of Norse people, mainly originating from present-day Sweden, settling and ruling along the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black Seas from around the 8th to 11th centuries AD. They formed a state known in modern historiography as Kievan Rus', which was initially a multiethnic society where the ruling Norsemen merged and assimilated with East Slavic, Baltic and Finnic tribes, ending up with Old East Slavic as their common language.#!"
 old_persian_desc: "#size:15    #F The Pars, or Old Persians, were an ancient $iran$ian people from the southwestern $iran$ian plateau, in a region known as Parsa (modern Fars). As speakers of Old Persian, they rose to prominence in the early Ist millennium BC, ultimately establishing the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great. This empire, expanded by rulers like Darius I and Xerxes, stretched from the Aegean to the Indus and was known for its administrative innovation, road systems, and relative tolerance. Even after its fall to Alexander the Great in the IVth century BC, Persian identity endured under Hellenistic and Parthian rule. In the IIIrd century AD, the Sasanian dynasty—claiming descent from the old Pars—revived many Achaemenid ideals, including centralized governance, Zoroastrian state religion, and imperial symbolism. Titles like $emperor_feudal_male_iranian_group$ (King of Kings) and renewed monumental architecture echoed their forebears. The Pars left a lasting legacy in imperial culture, governance, and religion, becoming a foundational force in the shaping of $iran$ian and broader Near Eastern history.#!"
 main_saka_desc: "#size:15    #F The Sakas were an $iran$ian nomadic group closely related to the Scythians, inhabiting the vast steppes of Central Asia. Unlike their western cousins, the Sakas migrated eastward, settling in regions such as Sogdiana, the Tarim Basin, and even parts of the Indian subcontinent. Divided into various subgroups, including the Indo-Scythians, the Sakas played a crucial role in the cultural exchanges between Central Asia, Persia, and India. Some groups established kingdoms in present-day Pakistan and India, influencing local art, warfare, and religion. Over time, the Sakas assimilated into surrounding cultures, particularly within the Kushan Empire, but their steppe traditions and warrior aristocracy left a lasting impact on the history of the region.#!"
 main_bedouin_desc: "#size:15    #F The Arabs are the descendants of various Arabian peoples who were most recently united under the banner of Islam. While they were disunited for much of their history, their recently achieved unification in the VIIth century under the banner of the Rashidun Caliphate allowed them to conquer much of the known world. Over the course of a mere century, the Arabs had managed to assert their rule over lands as far west as Hispania and as far east as Khorasan. With the spread of the new religion, the Arabic language and culture, reinforced by migration and assimilation, began to spread and diverge across the vast Islamic Empires, eventually giving rise to various new cultures in the process. Characterized by their Arabic language and their Arabic heritage, the Arabs exist primarily within the Arabian Peninsula but can also be found in substantial numbers in Mesopotamia, the Levante and the Maghreb.#!"
 israelite_desc: "#size:15    #F The Israelites trace their origins to the patriarch Jacob, also known as Israel, who according to tradition had twelve sons. These sons became the eponymous ancestors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph (whose two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, were often counted in his place), and Benjamin. These tribes formed the backbone of ancient Israelite society, each associated with a specific territory in the Land of Israel during the period of the united monarchy and afterward. However, over time, most of these tribes disappeared from history. Following the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in the late VIIIth century BC, ten of the northern tribes were exiled and assimilated into the broader Assyrian empire. These have since become known as the Ten Lost Tribes. Their fate remains uncertain, and various legends and theories have arisen around them throughout history. Only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which formed the core of the southern Kingdom of Judah, remained politically and culturally intact. These two tribes were not exiled during the Assyrian conquest and instead endured until the Babylonian exile in the VIth century BC. Even after the Babylonian captivity, members of these tribes returned and reestablished their religious and cultural institutions in Jerusalem. The Levites, though not counted among the twelve land-holding tribes, also continued to function in religious roles alongside Judah and Benjamin. As a result, modern Jewish identity is primarily descended from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, with Judah being the dominant identity—so much so that the term “Jew” (from Yehudi, meaning “of Judah”) became the standard designation for the people as a whole. This historical narrowing of tribal identity is largely due to the geopolitical divisions, successive conquests, and the survival of only the southern kingdom and its descendants.#!"
 elamite_desc: "#size:15    #F The Elamites were the last known phase of the Elamite civilization, thriving in the southwestern $iran$ian plateau between the IXth and VIth centuries BC. Despite their decline in power following the collapse of the earlier Elamite kingdoms, they maintained a distinct political and cultural presence, often resisting Assyrian and later Persian expansion. The Elamites are known for their complex relationship with the Neo-Assyrian Empire, alternately acting as its rivals and vassals. Despite repeated invasions by Assyrian kings such as Ashurbanipal, they managed to retain a degree of autonomy until the rise of the Achaemenid Persians, who ultimately absorbed Elamite lands into their empire. While the Elamite language and identity gradually faded under Persian rule, elements of their administrative and artistic traditions influenced the Achaemenid court. Characterized by their $iran$ian heritage, resilience against imperial expansion, and rich artistic traditions, the Elamites were among the last representatives of an ancient and influential civilization.#!"
 roman_desc: "#size:15    #F The Romans were an originally Latin people that inhabited the city of Rome but who's name and identity came to be adopted by much of the Mediterranean world over the course of the $roman$ Empire's history. While originally, in its narrowest sense, the term $roman$ denoted an inhabitant of the city of Rome, or a descendant of a $roman$ citizen, the very idea of what it meant to be $roman$ became progressively more generalized until in circa 212, $roman$ citizenship was finally granted to all inhabitants of the Empire. Over the course of Rome's history, the label came to denote more so a cultural lifestyle and legal status, rather than an actual ethnic identity, though more often than not it did take on such a form as well. Characterized by their Greek or Latin derived languages, as well as their Latin, $frankish$, Iberian, Vlach, Rhaetic or (Eastern) $roman$ heritages, the descendants of the Romans continue to constitute the majority population across much of the mediterranean.#!"

 on_oq_desc: "#size:15    #F The On-Oqs, or 'Ten Arrows', were a confederation of $turk$ic tribes that emerged after the fragmentation of the $gokturk$ Khaganate. They occupied regions of Central Asia and were closely involved with the early Islamic Caliphates and Chinese dynasties. Characterized by their nomadic traditions and military prowess, the On-Oqs played a significant role in the power struggles of the steppe.#!"
