The church gained its hierarchical distinctiveness in 512, when pro-Chalcedonian patriarch Flavian II of Antioch was deposed by Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, and a synod was held at Laodicea in Syria in order to choose his successor, a prominent Miaphysite theologian Severus the Great. His later deposition was not recognized by the Miaphisite party, and thus a distinctive (autocephalous) miaphysite patriarchate was established, headed by Severus and his successors. The nominal head of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch."

The Church of the East never accepted this condemnation though and Westerners have since then for varying reasons applied the term Nestorian to the Church of the East. The nominal head of the Church of the East is the Patriarch of the East. Despite this, its unique outlook has garnered followers in places as far east as China, India, and even Mongolia."
